\section{Overview: High-level components and their interaction}
The system is organized following the three tiers architecture. This aims to decouple logical layers in order to gurantee an horizontal scalability and a low fault tolerance.
Graphically it's shown in the figure~\ref{3tiers}.

\textbf{Presentation layer}. It's the front end layer which consists of the user interface. We have two types of user interface, depending on his functionality: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{CLup}: It's the mobile application used by users who have a smartphone. They can manage their booking by themselves;
\item \textbf{CLup Operator}: It's the desktop application used by receptionists that act as an intermediary to manage booking of users that have only a mobilephone.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Application layer}. It deals with the model of the system, by containing the business logic of the application. In our system it consists in a remote server to which mobile and desktop applications have to connect due to manage any bookings.

\textbf{Data layer}. It's composed by a data storage system. It includes: 

\begin{itemize}
\item User sensitive data asked during the registration process;
\item Information about user's grocery shopping;
\end{itemize}
